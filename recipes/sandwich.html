    <h3>How to Make a Sandwich</h3>
    <p>Sandwiches are a staple item in our house and probably yours.  But don't let one of your family's go to dishes get stale by serving the same thing night after night</p>
    <p>This recipe is a little different and for sure will have your kids asking for more.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices of Bread - Get some good bread</li>
        <li>Enough Cheese to cover the bread - Get some good cheese, we like sharp cheddar</li>
        <li>Heat - Get some good heat</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter one side of both pieces of bread, place the buttered side face down in a hot pan - not too hot! </li>
        <li>Place the cheese on top of the bread, making sure that the distribution over the bread is even.  You don't want piles of cheese!</li>
        <li>Close the sandwich by placing the second piece of bread on top of the first, buttered side up!</li>
        <li>Flip once or twice.  Pay careful attention not to burn the bread.</li>
        <li>Your sandwich is ready when the cheese is melty.</li>
    </ol>
