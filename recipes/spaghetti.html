    <h3>How to Make Spaghetti</h3>
    <p>Sometimes it feels like spaghetti is the only thing my kids will eat.  But luckily on those days like that I've got a few tricks up my sleeve to get them eating some vegetables alongside
        their penne.
    </p>
    <p>The trick to this recipe is to pack as many vegetables into the sauce as you can.  We use carrots and spinach as they work well with the tomato sauce without overpowering the classic tomato flavor</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 box of pasta</li>
        <li>1 jar of sauce</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 handful of spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin boiling water for the pasta </li>
        <li>Dice your onion, carrot, and spinach and with a little olive oil, sautee them together in the pan.  Start with the onions and carrots, as they will take much longer than the spinach.</li>
        <li>Once the onions and carrots have softened and the spinach is cooked, pour the sauce into the pan with the vegetables.</li>
        <li>That's it!  Now your sauce is loaded with vegetables and no one in the family wille even notice</li>
        <li>Another trick is to fold an egg or two into the pasta as well, some families really like it, but ours aren't huge fans.</li>
    </ol>
